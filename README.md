## Features

- Practice with core JavaScript array methods.
- Real-world data to manipulate.
- Clear and concise code examples.

## Exercises

1. #### Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's

   Use Array.prototype.filter() to create a list of inventors born in the 1500s.

2. #### Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names

   Use Array.prototype.map() to create an array of the inventors' full names.

3. #### Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest

   Use Array.prototype.sort() to sort the inventors by their birth year.

4. #### How many years did all the inventors live all together?

   Use Array.prototype.reduce() to find the total number of years all the inventors lived.

5. #### Sort the inventors by years lived

   Use Array.prototype.sort() to sort the inventors by the number of years they lived.

6. #### Create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name

   Scrape a Wikipedia page using Array.prototype.filter() and Array.prototype.map() to find boulevards with 'de' in the name.

7. #### Sort the people alphabetically by last name

   Use Array.prototype.sort() to sort a list of people by their last names.

8. #### Sum up the instances of each item in an array

   Use Array.prototype.reduce() to count the occurrences of each item in an array.
